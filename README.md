Problem description
Two intersections with independent controllers and two lanes going in between those intersections so we have to control the semaphores for those two intersections separately and synchronously. The first intersection has 4 exit lanes and 3 entering lanes and the second one has 3 exit lanes and 4 entering lanes from which two of each are connected in between.
